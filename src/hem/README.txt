This is a beta Version of the README.txt file of the HEM Project.

HEM is an online Environment for Heuristic Evaluations (HE Manager), a method originally developed by Jacob Nielsen.

Currently three Persons are working on that:

o Keith Andrews (keith@iicm.edu), who had the idea,
o Martin Loitzl (mloitzl@iicm.edu), who does the coding and
o Patrick Romano (p_romano@sbox.tugraz.at), who is responsible for the design matters.


Requirements for HEM:

o MySQL database server
o or a PHP Version capable of SQLite
o any current PHP Version (4 or 5) with GD support (needs PEAR, but the packages needed by HEM are included)
o A WebServer like Apache

Note: HEM is currently very unstable and is not ment to be used for production or even on production systems.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

kind regards,
martin loitzl - martin@loitzl.com
