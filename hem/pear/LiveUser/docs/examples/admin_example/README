This was a part of Example5, so the create_db.sql is almost indentical to example5 sql :)

This has only been tested with mysql like you can see by the connection string,
if you use something other then mysql then simply change the db connection string,
and report if any errors came while using other then mysql.

create_db.sql + perm_db.sql or perm_db_*.sql * = your db type  
Those files are needed to test this example, you can find them in data/sql

(you get perm_db.sql from /misc/schema)

When you read through the config files, then you probly will notice something like this
array('sequence_col_name' => 'id') in the MDB[2].
This was made so MDB[2] could use sequences from DB, so if one is moving from DB to MDB[2]
or something similar and couldn't change the SQL fields names then this would be a idle fix :)

And in this example you'll probly be using the same DB to test all the 3 containers, so this is
needed so no conflicts will come up.

MDB 1.3 is needed for this sequence_col_name to work (at the time MDB2 doens't have this);

Basiclly what this admin example does is making a new user, updating the user that was made before 
that user (i.e. added user_id - 1) and removes user (i.e. added user_id - 2)

Also this shows us info about the added user using getUser.
Also searchUsers is shown and printed out.

If you look at how we add the customFields:

$custom = array(
    array('name' => 'name',  'value' => 'asdf',             'type' => 'text'),
    array('name' => 'email', 'value' => 'fleh@example.com', 'type' => 'text')
);

This is the MDB[2] way ... for the DB container you can skip the type part, but doesn't hurt to have it,
DB simply ignores the type part.

This is how we do it when we are adding or updating a user with customFields. (for furhter info look at the source)


Now for getUser and searchUsers DB uses:

$custom = array(
    'name',
    'email'
);

but MDB[2] uses:

$custom = array(
    array('name' => 'name', 'type' => 'text'),
    array('name' => 'email', 'type' => 'text')
);

If you want that DB does it the same way. i.e.

$custom = array(
    'name' => 'name',
    'name' => 'email'
);

(DB container never needs type)
